# Text-and-Stroke-Generation

Based on the research paper [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf)

#### Key includes:

1. Mixed Density Network implementation(two normal and one bernoulli)
2. Encoder Decoder Architecture 
3. Attention Layer 
4. Probabilitic Loss Function as discussed in the paper
